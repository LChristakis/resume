# Luke Christakis VDOM Resume Project

A toy project to help me to better understand:
* React and other VDOM frameworks
* Babel and other transpiling and templating systems

The ultimate goal is to take a Javascript template of a resume and a JSON representation of my resume information and to marry them and present them in an aesthetically pleasing and informative way.

This code is meant to be educational and is not recommended for use elsewhere.

In developing this resume, I drew from the following resources:
* [Deathmood: How to write your own Virtual DOM](https://medium.com/@deathmood/how-to-write-your-own-virtual-dom-ee74acc13060)
* [JASON Format: WTF is JSX](https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/)
